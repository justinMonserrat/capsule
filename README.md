# Capsule

**Capsule** is a personal media tracker built for people who enjoy more than just one kind of entertainment. Whether itâ€™s movies, TV shows, books, or music Capsule lets you log, organize, and review the media you experience, all in one place.

The goal is to create a web app that helps users keep track of what theyâ€™ve watched, read, or listened to without being locked into a single platform. 

It's your own personal time capsule.
